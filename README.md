# RodeoRunner

Rodeo runner is an endless runner game I created in the Godot Game-Engine to improve my godot skills. The game features riding animals running through terrain. You can jump from animal to animal.
But you die when you crash into obstacles or the ground (when jumping).

The game is available for Desktop (Windows and Linux) and Android. You find builds in the release panel of this Repo.
